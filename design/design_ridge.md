# Golden Ridge Design Notes

## Ideas
 first room could be granny room
 in the beggining section moving platforms could be added along with a level to support it (although prob not cause it isn't used after iirc)
 add a side challenge(s) to the first block room if space allows for it?
 turn gondolla into flag
 add strawberry seeds for some rooms?

## Key Levels

2 levels each introducing clouds and green bubbles like in the original  
2 or 3 levels after letting you play with these mechanics (should include the block breaking level with bubbles)
1 long level introudcing wind 
about 3 - 4 more wind levels that start combining the other mechanincs
a transition room to the moving blocks section
block tutorial level that should be tall 
2 - 3 more block levels
5 levels combining all these mechanics together
2 new levels each introducing strong wind and snowballs
2 levels for snowballs exclusively
5 more levels of combining all of these mechanics
1 level of wind helping you at the end like in newleste

## Order of teaching mechanics:
- Clouds
- Green Bubble
- Breakable Blocks
- Wind
- Moving Blocks
- Strong Wind
- Snowballs
